            <p>This website belongs to Akeem Richards, a second-year SOSCAI student at the UWI Five Islands Campus. As a proud Jamaican, 
                my passions include playing and watching football, as well as spending what some might call an unhealthy amount of time 
                in the gym. I am currently working toward becoming a software Engineer and Cyber Security Specialist. Web development teaches 
                me the basics of the web, which are essential for anyone pursuing a career in cybersecurity.
